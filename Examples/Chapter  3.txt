Chapter 3 Quesitons and answers

label   ask 'question_text'
        resp resp_type [resp_list]

label = unique name for this question.
ask = is the Quancept keyword wich introduces a question
question_text is the text of the question

resp = keywrod wich introduces a response list
resp_type = the response type(for example, single-punched)
resp_list = the list of permitted responses.

example with a single-punched response list

day     ask 'What day did you go?'
        resp sp 'monday' / 'tuesday' / 'wednesday' / 'thursday' /
                'friday' / 'saturday' / 'sunday'

Response type:

sp: single-pnched responses (one response only)
mp: multipunched responses (one or more responses)
num: numeric responses that are whole numbers
real: numeric responses that are decimal numbers
coded: open-ended (verbatim) responses
dbase: responses chosen from a Quancept database
list: responses are the names of definied response lists

///Single-pnched and multipunched responses

Quick Reference
single-punched list:
    resp    sp 'resp1'/'resp2'/..../'respN'
multipunched response list:
    resp    mp 'resp1'/'resp2'/..../'respN'

///Numeric responses

Quick Reference
range of integer(whole number) responses, type:
    resp num lowes [to highest]

use n- and n+ for open-ended ranges.

Enter lists of single values or ranges separated by slashes as for single-punched responses.

All numbers must be whole numbers in the range -999,999,999 to +999,999,999.

specify the permissible response as range of numbers.
Example:

people  ask 'How many people were there in your party?'
        resp num 1 to 20

this program accept any number between 1 and 20 incluse as the response to this quesiton.

if one number is negative, this counts as the lowe end of the range and must come first. If both
values are negative, we would write, for instance:

resp num -100 to -52

//Open-ended responses 

Quick Reference
open-ended (verbatim) responses, type:

mrInterview     resp coded
CATI/CAPI/Web:  resp coded[(n)]

for default is to allocate 29 codes (3 columns) for coding of the open-ended text.
To request more or fewer codes, enter the number of codes you requiere in the parentheses.
